- I trained Nvidia's StyleGAN2 (https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2) on 959 images of paintings, generated new paintings, then employed image sampling using Grasshopper to create the renders below. 
- Please see https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AUVmc1wYSJ01JFvqGa4Bb0OERLdA0fXg/view?usp=sharing for the trained model.
